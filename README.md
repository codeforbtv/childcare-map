# Child Care Center Visualization

> Documenting child care capacity as it relates to population

This application is a simple prototype created during the Hack the Stacks event to demonstrate a possible user-friendly, map based interface for doing research of child care facilities around the Burlington area.  

This map was made possible because we had a relatively rich set of data for the facilities, including addresses and star ratings.  Unfortunately it is not clear where an updated set of this information could be obtained so this map is static and will quickly become out of date.

It can be [previewed here](http://codeforbtv.github.io/childcare-map/)
